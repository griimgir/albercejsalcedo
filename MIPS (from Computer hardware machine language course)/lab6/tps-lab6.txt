--TPS1--
1)Text Segment: 0x00400000
  Data Segment: 0x10010000

2) From the look of it source is much easier in readability and basic is a less readable since
it shows actual binary.

3) the difference between each address are 32 bytes

4) there ae 8 columns, because 32/4 is 8

5) each 4 byte the addresses travers through a column is created.

6) m:	.word 20

7) The address of m is in 0x00000014

8)		li $v0, 4
		la $a0, str1
		syscall

9)	str1 is stored in 0x6f6c2049 & 0x43206576 & 0x31334553 & 0x00000021

10) It does, it stores all the characters in str1 byte by byte starting from right to left within each 4 bytes

11) li $a0, str1
	syscall

12) We are loading n -> t3 to be executed as 0x10010000
