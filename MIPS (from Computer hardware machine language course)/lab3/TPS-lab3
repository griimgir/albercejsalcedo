1) Stack, heap, and static. Stack stores variable declerations with variable name, the address of the variable, and the stored data of data type.
heap stores space requested for pointers via malloc(). Finally static stores variables outside of main function and can be used in other
struct functions.

2)  a) 4 varibales are declared. 
    b) one int, one float, 1 pointer, and one next pointer.
    c) stack and heap
    d) heap, it is requesting space of type sizeof(int). Integers are 4 bytes.

3) these [ointers are not stored contigiously, instead they hop around the memory pointing to the next address with the stored data type.
Head is the current node which has a next pointer that points to the next head.

1) you need to pass the array because the algorithm needs to make a copy, and with that copy it will sort it and then replace the old array with the new sorted array.

2)No, the original array is only copied, and will later be replaced with the new sorted array.

3) So you can maniplulate one without changing the original, this will make it possible to print the original array and the new sorted array.
