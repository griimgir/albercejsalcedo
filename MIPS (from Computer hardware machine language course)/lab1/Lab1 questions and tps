Elyse searched up how to set it up on a mac.

-TPS Activity 2-

1) The Xfce terminal is in the menu bar. I can either search t up or use a bind key I have set up for it.
	a) Yes I can open more than one termnal and even use different terminals depending what I am doing. I tend to use URXVT terminal for text editing and xfce terminal for everything else.
	b) It depends what I am doing. For instance vim works alot better on URXVT-terminal on my linux machine so I will use that. If I want to do anything else like navigate or use terminal programs I'll use XFCE default terminal.

1) - https://gcc.gnu.org/
   - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/gcc-command-in-linux-with-examples/
3) gcc -o [name] [filename]
4) If it compiles it wont throw you any errors. It should show you nothing.
5) -c compiles and assemble, but do not link.
6) -g is a parameter that automatically get passed on to different various sub-processes invoked by gcc. This is used to Degbug
7)how I change the file name is i use nano to write out as a different name.
8)gcc cc compiles without a name and executes it using ./a.out. Compiling this way will allow you to overwrite the previous compiled file.
9)./a.out


Pseudocode

	int posnumbers
	int negnumbers
	int num
	int plusCounter
	int negCounter

do{
	print "Please enter an integer"
	scan number
	
		if number is positive
			posnumbers += num
			plusCounter++
		else if negative
			negnumbers += neg
			negCounter++
		else
			if plusCounter does not = 0
				print positive average
			if negCunter does not = 0
				print negative average
			endif
		endif
}while(num is not = 0)
