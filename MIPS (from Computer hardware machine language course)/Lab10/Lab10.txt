--TPS 1--
1) A cache is a copy of a subset of main memory which uses static RAM (SRAM). We need this becuase cache is fast, the typical access time for cache is usually .5 - 2.5 ns.
This is much faster than regular memory which uses dyncamic RAM (DRAM). It gives access to the memory faster but is low in capacity. It
is also very expensive to have large capacity cache.

4) We need 4 bits for an offset. Bloack size function is: f(n) = log2(n) where n is block size. It is not practical to have
a block size of 1 byte because that is far too small.

5) We would need 6 bits for the index. The function for number of bits in index is: log2(n), where n = blocks in cache.

6) We can find the total size of the cache by multiplying the # of blocks(16) and the block size(64): 16 * 64 = total size of cache.

7) We use the remaining bits to calculate the tag. This is important because the tag bits is used to check if it has the correct block in
memory.

8) Legend: 20 bits, 128B of cache 8B block size
	a) 2^20 -> 1,048,576 -> 1MB. This is the max capacity.
	b) 3 bits
	c) 128/8 = 16 blocks.
	d) 4 bits
	e) 20 - 7 = 13 bits
	f)	[Tag(13)]	[Valid(1)]	[Dirty(10)]		[Blocksize in bits(64)]
	g) 79 bits

--TPS 2--
1) disadvatage of direct-mapped cache - Since multiple memory addresses map to same cache 
index so we cannot be sure if it is the right one. Conflict miss.

3) log2(256) = 8 bits
	256 sets in each cache = 1024 of blocks/ 4 associativity
4)
	a) 2^20 = 1MB
	b) log2(8) = 3bits
	c) 128/8 = 16 blocks
	d) 8 sets
	e) log2(8)
	f) 14 tag bits
	g)	[Tag bits(14)]	[Valid bits(1)]		[Dirty bits(1)]		[Blocksize(64 bits)]
	h) 64 + 1 + 1 +14 = 80 bits.

Ryzen7 CPU

1 & 2 & 3)it has L1-D, L1-I, L2, L3 cache: in total there are 3 levels. and L1 is split, D-cache is
32KB(8 ways 64 byte line size) and I-cache is 64kb(4-way, 64 byte line size)
4) they are arll associative
5)offset: log2(8) = 6 and the tag bits
	tagbits: 40 - 12 =28
