1) 
procedures - does not return a value, it is a task
function - returns one or more values and provide explanations on arguements
method - is a function that executes an object

4) line 20. a0 -> a1 -> v0
the sum of a0 and a1 is stored into v0

5)
we can use the j command as long as we instruct it where to go.

6) it is saved to $ra (line 11). In this case 0 is being saved which doesnt make sense bnecause we need the address to return to 13.

7) It gets terminated after it runs through SUM

8) it needs to return to 0x00400028

9) no becuase of the infinite loop

10) new address: 0x00400028. Output: 15

11)jal

--TPS 1--
1) output 38

3)
The wrong value is being stored for $ra because it was changed to SUB. We are going to plan to restore this to the correct place.

4) $a0 -> s
5) we are going to store m -> $s4
6)in code
