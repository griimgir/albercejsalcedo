1)  .word is the size of your pointer to you data.
    .data data that is stored in memory
    .test is where instructions are stored
2)  beq is there so this line copares two values t see if they are equal
3)  j jumps to fib function which starts at line 10
4)  you assemble it and then check line 15 for a breakpoint then run. 
5)  then just run one by one as you would normally proceed. To continue and run your code you 
    can remove the breakpoint by assembling it again.
6)  you would have to change the values after you slowed down how fast it runs each line
    there is a slider which allows you to change the speed that it runs the code.
7)  n is stored in $t3 the 13th fibbinochi
8)  syscall is a function for input and output
